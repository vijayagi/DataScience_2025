#### **explanation of interpretation, compilation and portability:**



##### **1.interpretation:**

* when you write python code, its like writing a story in English
* To explain it to the computer python has interpreter who reads the code line by line and instantly explains it to the computer.
* makes it interactive and flexible,but slower comapared to fully compiled languages.





**conclusion**: that's why python is called interpreted.

##### 

##### **2.Compilation:**



* even though python is an interpreter, it still does a little bit of compilation.
* before a interpreter explains your code, it makes a quick secret copy of your code in a simpler language (called bytecode) which is **platform independent.**
* bytecode is like shorthand notes that are faster for the interpreter to read.
* interpreter uses these notes to tell the computer what to do.



**conclusion** :python is not compiled like C ,but does a small compilation step.

##### 

##### **3.Portability:**



* In other languages you need to write the whole code again.
* but with python you don't need to because the code is compiled to bytecode(which is platforem independent), the same program can run on different OS as long as the correct pyhton interpreter is installed.

Conclusion:' write once, run anywhere'
